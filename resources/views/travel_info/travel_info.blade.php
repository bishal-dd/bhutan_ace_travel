    <h2 class="mt-3">Visa to Bhutan</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        The Bhutanese visa process may appear complicated but is actually quite straightforward once you understand the system. Most countries issue visas from their embassies abroad and stamp them in your passport, but not Bhutan. Bhutanese embassies abroad cannot issue Visas for visit to Bhutan. You must apply in advance through a tour operator such as Ace Travel and receive approval before you travel to Bhutan. Once the full payment of your holiday (including a $40 visa fee) has been wire transferred and received in the TCB bank account then only visas are approved by the Immigration Department and Department of Tourism Bhutan (DoT) in Thimphu, which you allowed to enter Bhutan or board the Druk Air flight and Bhutan Airlines.
The actual visa is stamped on the passport upon arrival in the country, either at Paro airport or (if entering by road) at Phuentsholing. You just need to provide us details as per your passport that should include your name, permanent address, occupation, nationality, date, and place of birth, passport number, more than six months valid and its date and place of issue, and date of expiration. There is no need to send the pictures or sign the visa application at this time. Double-check that the information you send is correct; if there are any discrepancies when you arrive in Bhutan, there will be further delays and complications.
Except for visitors from India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, all other visitors to Bhutan need a visa.
Indian, Bangladeshis, and Maldivian nationals can obtain a visa or entry permit at the port of entry on producing a valid passport with a minimum of 6-month validity (Indian nationals may also use their Voter‚Äôs Identity Card (VIC)).
