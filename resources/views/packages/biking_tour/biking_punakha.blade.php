                            Nestled high in the Eastern Himalayas, Bhutan is a land like no other, a time-honored realm where tradition and tranquility harmoniously coexist.
                            Known as the "Land of the Thunder Dragon," this mystical kingdom is a sanctuary of untouched natural beauty, rich
                            cultural heritage, and profound spirituality. As you embark on a journey into the heart of Bhutan, you'll discover
                            a land that seems to have been plucked from the pages of a fairy tale,
                            where every hillside whispers stories of ancient legends and where happiness is not merely a goal but a way of life.

                            Bhutan's pristine landscapes encompass some of the most awe-inspiring terrain in the world. From the lush,
                            subtropical forests of the south to the towering peaks and glaciers of the north, Bhutan offers a breathtaking
                            panorama of ecological diversity. Towering mountains, including the legendary Gangkhar Puensum, the world's
                            highest unclimbed peak, are punctuated by pristine rivers and valleys.
                            The landscapes provide not only stunning vistas but also opportunities for hiking, trekking, and adventure.

                                    Buddha film was shot here. Walk down to the old traditional bridge below the Paro Dzong. Here, you
                                    will have opportunity to try Bhutanese dress and take a beautiful photo with castle in the background!
                                    Continue to Paro airport viewpoint. Depending on schedule, you might see planes landing and taking off.
                                    Runway in Paro is famed as one of the most demanding of all World&#39;s International airports. Enjoy the
