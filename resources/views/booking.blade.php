    <h2 class="mt-3">How to book</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        It is advisable to book your holiday several months in advance to ensure the smooth planning of your trip. Since tourism started relatively recently in Bhutan, tourist infrastructure is still limited. There is also a limited number of flights in and out of the country. This means that peak season can be quite busy, so the earlier you book, the better chance we have of securing flights and good hotel rooms for you.
     </p>

     <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        At festival times you may need to book over six months ahead to get flights, especially if you are unable to be flexible and are tied to particular dates.  Also if you have particular preferences for hotels then the sooner you book the better chance we have of securing these for you.  Most hotels in Bhutan have only 15 to 20 rooms or so and they can get booked up over 9 to 12 months ahead of time for the busiest dates in peak season, so the earlier you contact us the more likely it is we can meet your preferences.     </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">A Simple Guide to Booking your Trip</h2>

                                </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">Flights</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        There are now two airlines that operate flights in and out of Bhutan.  Druk Air (also known as Royal Bhutan Airlines) is Bhutan’s national carrier and Tashi Air (also known as Bhutan Airlines) is a private airline which started operating in 2013 and has brought in some much needed competition. There is one international airport at Paro, about an hour’s drive from the capital, Thimphu. There are also some new domestic routes in operation with domestic airports at Batpalathang in Bumthang, Yongphula in eastern Bhutan (close to Tashigang) and Gelephu in the south of the country.    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        You can have a look at the schedules on the Druk Air website and the Tashi Air website to help you plan your trip.    <p class="text-justify">
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Druk Air and Tashi Air flights can now be booked directly yourself online, but it is usually preferable for you to ask us to make the booking for you and we don’t charge for this service. If you buy the tickets from the airline websites you have to pay for them on purchase, whereas we can hold the seats for you for a period without commitment while we discuss your itinerary with you and you take the time to finalise your travel plans. Also, if we book the seats for you we get advance notice of timing changes, we can assist you with ticketing changes and we will also reconfirm your flights for you automatically as long as we have made the booking for you. Finally we often have access to discounts which are available only to agents and not for direct bookings – we will tell you if these are on offer at the time of your trip.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        You will need to arrange your own international flights to your chosen point of entry to Bhutan. You should wait until we have confirmed your reservations with Druk Air/Tashi Air before you make long haul bookings. Bear in mind also that the airline schedules for Bhutan flights are subject to frequent change, and often at very short notice, so if you can arrange flexible long haul tickets it is advisable to do so.  We advise that you leave 5 to 6 hours connection time if possible and if you can plan an overnight stay each end of your trip before and after flying to Bhutan then so much the better.    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        These airlines do not take any responsibility for the impact of timing changes or cancellations on any other flight reservations, and we also cannot do so, which means that you will have to bear the cost of any changes to your travel plans caused by changes to the Bhutan airline schedules.   
     </p>

     <h2 class="mt-3">Routings</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        The main international routings used to fly in to Paro are Delhi, Kathmandu, Bangkok, Singapore and Calcutta. There are also flights from Dhaka, Gaya, Bagdogra and Guwahati and Mumbai.   
     </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Bangkok flights come in and out every day with both airlines (and at busy times there are two or three flights a day) but flights on the other routings are not as frequent. Delhi and Kathmandu flights tend to be daily (or sometimes twice daily at the peak of the season). Calcutta flights run around 5 times a week with Druk Air and daily with Tashi Air and Singapore flights are twice a week with Druk Air. Flights from Dhaka, Bagdogra and Guwahati are usually twice a week in each direction.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-3">Ticketing</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        The ticketing system used by the airlines allows us to hold seats for a period so you have time to decide on your dates and organise your international flights before we have to issue the tickets. For travel dates which are more than 45 days away, the ticketing date will be between 30 to 90 days from the date of booking, depending on availability. If seats are still available on the flight we can keep extending the reservation for further periods of 30 days until the flight fills up and we have to issue the tickets. For travel dates less than 45 days but more than 14 days away the ticketing date will be 7 days from the date of booking. For travel dates within 14 days, no ticketing date will be available and the flights must be paid for on booking to secure the seats.     </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Bangkok flights come in and out every day with both airlines (and at busy times there are two or three flights a day) but flights on the other routings are not as frequent. Delhi and Kathmandu flights tend to be daily (or sometimes twice daily at the peak of the season). Calcutta flights run around 5 times a week with Druk Air and daily with Tashi Air and Singapore flights are twice a week with Druk Air. Flights from Dhaka, Bagdogra and Guwahati are usually twice a week in each direction.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-3">Baggage allowance</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        The baggage allowance is usually 30 kg in economy class and 40 kg in business class, although this may differ depending on the routing so you should check your ticket.   
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-3">Travelling Overland</h2>

        <p class="text-justify mt-5">
            It is also possible to enter or leave Bhutan by road via Phuntsholing on the Indian border in the south-west or at Samdrup Jongkhar in the south-east. This allows you to combine a trip to Bhutan with some time in Darjeeling or Sikkim or Assam. Phuntsholing is three or four hours’ drive from the nearest Indian airport in Bagdogra in West Bengal, and about seven hours’ drive from Thimphu. From Samdrup Jongkhar it is about a three hour drive to Guwahati which has flights to and from a number of Indian cities.
        </p>
    <h2 class="mt-3">Payments</h2>

    <p class="text-justify mt-5">
        Payment for your trip is usually made in US$ via bank transfer to the Bank of Bhutan, with your tour operator shown as the ultimate beneficiary of the funds.  On receipt the payment is transferred to the government account, as explained further below.
        We will provide you with all the information needed to make the transfer once your choice of trip is confirmed. We ask for payment 90 days in advance of the tour to give us plenty of time to finalise the arrangements for your booking. We don’t require payment of a deposit, but if you are visiting in peak season we may need to issue your flight tickets as much as 6 months or more beforehand (if the flight has filled up) and in that case we will ask you to send payment for the flight tickets only at an earlier stage.   
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
        <b>Payment Shortfalls</b>
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify ">
        It is not uncommon for there to be a small shortfall on receipt of the funds. The reason for this may be that intermediary banks deduct charges en route, or (where payment is not sent in US$) because your bank will work out the sterling or other currency equivalent of the dollar amount on sending, but the money is converted on arrival in Bhutan at the prevailing dollar rate, which may be different. We charge a US$30 administration fee when processing your payment which helps us to cover these costs. If there is a shortfall of more than this we will confirm to you the exact amount received (and if requested send you a copy of the receipt from our bank) and will ask you to make up the shortfall in US$ cash on arrival.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-3">Security</h2>
    <p class="text-justify ">
        Whether you make payment by bank transfer or via the online payment gateway, your funds will be held in the government account and will not be released to Ace travel until after your tour has taken place. This provides you with the security of knowing that your money is safe until your holiday takes place. If for any reason the trip doesn’t go ahead then the government will not give your money to Blue Poppy but will return it to you (subject to any cancellation charges which apply if you have cancelled the trip). So in the unlikely event that we do not run your trip for you, you would not be out of pocket.
        Please note that if you decide to book with Ace Travel you will be booking with us as a local Bhutanese tour operator, licensed and registered in Bhutan, subject to regulation by the Department of Tourism and a member of ABTO (the Association of Bhutanese Tour Operators). Any disputes regarding your booking are to be resolved by arbitration under the laws of Bhutan. 
    </p> 
    <h2 class="mt-3">Cancellation terms (tours)</h2>
    <p class="text-justify ">
        Once booked, Ace Travel tours that are cancelled are subject to the following cancellation charges:
    </p> 
    <p class="text-justify">
        <b>-</b> Earlier than 30 days before the start of the tour programme: 10% of the rates
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify"> 
        <b>-</b> Between 30 and 21 days before the start: 20% of the rates
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <b>-</b> Between 21 and 14 days before the start: 25% of the rates
     </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <b>-</b>Between 14 and 7 days before the start: 40% of the rates
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify"> 
        <b>-</b> Less than 7 days before the start or cancellation without notice: 60% of the rates
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify"> 
        <b>-</b> After arrival in Bhutan: 100% of the rates.    
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
        If you cancel your tour after you have sent payment, then we will process your refund in accordance with the above list of charges. To return funds to you from Bhutan we have to request permission from the Royal Monetary Authority to send foreign currency outside Bhutan. Once we have this we have to ask the Tourism Council of Bhutan to return the funds to you, as they are still holding them at that point since your tour has not yet run. This process of arranging the refund can take some time – at busy periods even 6 to 8 weeks.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Please note also that when your currency arrives in Bhutan it is booked to Ace Travel in local currency at the then prevailing rate of exchange. When we come to return funds to you the cost of the refund will be booked to us again at the then prevailing rate of exchange. If there has been significant fluctuation in exchange rates between the date when funds were received in Bhutan and the date the payment is refunded we reserve the right to return no more than the current US$ equivalent of the amount originally received by us in local currency, to avoid incurring a loss as a result of currency fluctuation when returning your funds for the cancelled trip.
        </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Sometimes it may be possible to postpone the tour instead of cancelling – we can discuss the options with you if this idea appeals. Note however, that once postponed past the date of the original trip the above cancellation conditions will no longer apply and the payments you have made for the tour and flights will no longer be refundable on the same basis, so you should not take this option unless you believe that you will go ahead with the trip on the new dates.
        </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Finally, note that if you have booked any nights in luxury accommodation then the cancellation terms differ according to the hotel. Generally speaking, once full payment is due on these hotels (around 30 days to 60 days before the date of stay) then no refund is available on cancellations after this point – we can provide further details of the precise terms on request.
